## 1. Introduction
The Furuta Pendulum is driven by an arm which rotates in the horizontal plane and a pendulum attached to that arm which rotates in the vertical plane. 
It was invented by a man named Katsuhisa Furuta at the Tokyo Institute of Technology in 1922. The pendulum must exihibt the following traits:
It must stay up right and when it is knocked down it must reurn to the upright position.

## 2. Modeling
The system is comprised of 2 masses, the rotary arm in the horiontal plane and the pendulum in the vertical plane. The rotary arm and the pendulum are limked. A DC motor is applying torque to the rotary arm that controls the swaying of the pendulum to remain in an upright position. The torque is used the feedback control system. The angles of both the rotary arm and the pendulum are 0 when in the upright position. It is assumed postive when rotating counter-clockwise. The system is stable when the pendulum is allowed to hang down.
