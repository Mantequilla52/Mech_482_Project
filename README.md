## 1. Introduction
The Furuta Pendulum is driven by an arm which rotates in the horizontal plane and a pendulum attached to that arm which rotates in the vertical plane. 
It was invented by a man named Katsuhisa Furuta at the Tokyo Institute of Technology in 1922. The pendulum must exihibt the following traits:
-Must stay up right
