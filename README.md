## 1. Introduction
The Furuta pendulum has been in use since 1992, when it was invented by Katsuhisa Furuta. The Furuta pendulum, or the rotational inverted pendulum consists of a driven arm rotating in the horizontal plane. In the following report is the design, implementation, and analyzation through state space representation of the Furuta pendulum, Figure 1 provides a depiction of the analyzed. The system will become balanced in real time using an engineered simulation, which is connected through a state space representation equation
